Student Performance Prediction Project
Overview
Welcome to the Student Performance Prediction project repository! This project marks my debut into the world of machine learning and data science. Inspired by a YouTube tutorial, I embarked on this journey to apply my newfound knowledge and skills to solve a real-world problem: predicting students' performance in exams based on various demographic and academic factors.

Key Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, I gained invaluable insights and learnings, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring and visualizing the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that inform feature selection and model development.
Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train predictive models, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
Web Development: Integrating machine learning models into a web application using Flask, creating user-friendly interfaces for data input and result display.
Project Management: Organizing project structure, version control with Git, collaborating with others, and managing dependencies.
